# My Library & Research Collection

A curated digital garden showcasing books, research papers, and essays that have significantly influenced my worldview. This project serves as both a personal archive and a public resource for exploring transformative ideas.

## Project Overview

This website is designed with an **"Ethereal Minimalism"** aesthetic, prioritizing readability and a calm, contemplative user experience. It features a responsive grid layout where each item is presented as a card that reveals source links upon interaction.

### Key Features
- **Curated Collection**: A hand-picked selection of influential texts across various disciplines.
- **Interactive Design**: Smooth hover effects that "lift" book covers and reveal action buttons.
- **Filtering System**: Instant filtering between "Books," "Papers," and the full collection.
- **Responsive Layout**: A masonry-style grid that adapts seamlessly from mobile to desktop screens.
- **Ethereal Aesthetic**: A warm, organic color palette using sage greens and soft creams, paired with elegant serif typography.

## Tech Stack

This project was built using a modern, performance-focused stack:

| Category | Tool | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Frontend Framework** | [React 19](https://react.dev/) | The latest version of React for building the user interface. |
| **Styling** | [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) | Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling. |
| **Build Tool** | [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) | Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development and optimized builds. |
| **Routing** | [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) | A minimalist, hook-based routing library for React. |
| **Icons** | [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) | Beautiful, consistent, and customizable icons. |
| **Typography** | [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) | Using *Playfair Display* for headings and *Inter* for body text. |
| **Deployment** | [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) | Zero-configuration deployment and hosting. |

## How It Was Built

The development process followed a structured approach to ensure high quality and performance:

1.  **Design Conception**: Inspired by digital gardens and minimalist archives, we chose an "Ethereal Minimalism" theme.
2.  **Project Initialization**: Scaffolded a static web project using React and Vite.
3.  **Component Architecture**: Built reusable components like `LibraryCard` to handle display logic and hover states.
4.  **Data Structure**: Created a structured data file (`data.ts`) to manage the collection, making it easy to add new items.
5.  **Styling & Theming**: Configured Tailwind CSS with a custom color palette (sage, cream, charcoal) and typography settings.
6.  **Deployment**: Connected the local repository to GitHub, which automatically triggers deployments on Vercel.
